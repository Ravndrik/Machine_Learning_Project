The Iris Flower dataset is a classic dataset used in machine learning. It contains measurements of sepal and petal lengths and widths in centimeters for three species of iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. This dataset is commonly used for practicing classification techniques and benchmarking models due to its simplicity and clear class labels
Certainly, the Iris Flower dataset includes measurements for three species of iris flowers:

Iris setosa: This is one of the three species in the dataset, known for its distinctive appearance, including shorter petals and sepals compared to the other species.

Iris versicolor: Another species in the dataset, Iris versicolor is characterized by its medium-sized petals and sepals and a different coloration compared to Iris setosa and Iris virginica.

Iris virginica: The third species in the dataset, Iris virginica, typically has longer and wider petals and sepals compared to the other two species
